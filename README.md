# Mobile Price Range Prediction

**Project Summary:**

In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, smartphones have seamlessly integrated into our daily lives, offering a myriad of options for consumers to choose from. This project, titled "Mobile Price Range Prediction," ventures into the realm of predictive analytics, specifically focusing on the estimation of mobile phone prices based on their distinctive specifications and features. By accurately forecasting mobile phone price ranges, this project seeks to provide invaluable insights to manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, aiding them in making informed decisions.

**Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to construct robust and accurate machine learning models capable of predicting the price range of mobile phones. These predictions will be grounded in various attributes, including battery power, dual SIM functionality, RAM capacity, storage specifications, and a host of other technical features. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we aim to empower stakeholders in the mobile phone industry with a predictive tool that enhances decision-making processes.

**Methodology:**

The project is meticulously structured, encompassing the following key stages:

1. **Data Collection:** Acquiring an appropriate dataset is foundational. The dataset employed in this project is a repository of mobile phone attributes and their corresponding price ranges.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data integrity is of paramount importance. This stage involves cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring uniform formatting.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Crafting relevant features is instrumental. The project involves selecting pertinent attributes and engineering new features that could enhance the predictive power of the models.

4. **Model Selection:** Opting for the right machine learning algorithms is essential. Various classification algorithms will be explored, evaluated, and compared to determine the most suitable for the task.

5. **Model Training:** Training the selected models is a crucial phase. The models will be exposed to the training dataset, allowing them to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between mobile phone attributes and price ranges.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation is conducted to gauge the models' performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be utilized to assess their predictive capabilities.
